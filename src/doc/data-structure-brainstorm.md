| Data Structure        | Description/ Remarks      | Good for                                              | Bad for                           |

| Array (list)          |                           | Fast O(1) retrieval of known position, fast insertion | Search is slow, O(n), no ordering |
| Linked list           |                           |                                                       |                                   |
