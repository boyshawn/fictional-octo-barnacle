Maybe start with reading Algorithms Unlocked first, from [to_what_do_you_refer, reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/393i68/a_guide_to_read_clrs/cs05gbe)

From [Aika Sama, Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-self-study-Introduction-to-Algorithms/answer/Aika-Sama)
* Understand for which problems each algorithm and data structure is used. For example: Fibonacci heap is usually used in Djikstraâ€™s algorithm
* Understand which algorithms are improvements to simpler algorithms (same applies to data structures). For example: Fibonacci heap is an improvement to Binomial heap.

Following this:
* Read and understand one topic at a time and think of problems where you can use it
* Implement the topic to give yourself a practical boost (Actually, I did this only for a few advanced algorithms)
* Spend time going through the questions at the end of each chapter (this will enhance your deep understanding)

From [Abhijeet Mohanty, Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-self-study-Introduction-to-Algorithms/answer/Abhijeet-Mohanty-8),
As far as reading proof of correctness is concerned, I would recommend it to be read for classical algorithms such as those for sorting and searching. Other than correctness of proof, it is necessary to have an idea as to the different kinds of input cases an algorithm can take and weeding out edge cases which would make the algorithm fail. CLRS illustrates very well, the trace of an algorithm and therefore instead of jumping into the algorithm itself, it would do you a world of good if you were to try and implement an algorithm from its trace itself. An even more important thing is computing the time and space complexity of an algorithm, which would give you a better idea as to how to eliminate redundant operations, to cache results for better optimisation etc.

From [Sada Kurapati, Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-should-one-read-Introduction-to-Algorithms-CLRS-to-get-the-most-out-of-it/answer/Sada-Kurapati),
Before reading this book, try to read [Algorithms Unlocked: Thomas H. Cormen](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Unlocked-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262518805), It explains the algorithms in high level and strengthens the foundation. 

* Go through the chapter
* Complete the exercises listed out after each chapter
* Write the code in JAVA on PAPER.
* Execute the code on computer
* Look for related problems online
* Watch video of that topic from [Introduction to Algorithms0(http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
* Repeat for every new topic
