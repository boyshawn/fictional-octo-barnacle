This repository will store the practice questions I have written in preparation for technical interviews. Currently it contains coding question from _Cracking the Coding Interview_ and _Leetcode_.

The Java coding style follows the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), except for the line width. CheckStyle helps to perform the style check.
